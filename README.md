# Thiago's Vim dotfiles

Highly suited for general-heavy editing, specially with PHP, Ruby and Javascript.

## Installation:

Usable right off the bat, just clone the repo and fire setup.sh.

    $ git clone git://github.com/thiagoa/dotvim.git ~/.vim 
    $ ~/.vim/setup.sh

## Create per machine configuration (optional):

    $ touch ~/.vimrc.local
    $ touch ~/.gvimrc.local

## Take a look at the built-in features

Check out my well commented vimrc and the "bundle" dir, to see which plugins
are installed.
